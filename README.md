# Data Science Capstone
This repository contains my final work on the Data Science Capstone, from IBM

The main work in this repository is an analysis of Covid-19 cases in Brazil per region. 

- [This file](https://github.com/marcellongvb/datasciencecapstone/blob/master/Introduction%20and%20data%20description.pdf) contains an introduction about the study and the data in use.

- The main work can be viewed in [this notebook](https://github.com/marcellongvb/datasciencecapstone/blob/master/Analysis_of_Covid_19_in_Brazil.ipynb). The notebook is very big, so github may not show a preview. If this is the case, you can also view the work in the [IBM watson studio notebook](https://dataplatform.cloud.ibm.com/analytics/notebooks/v2/4b93e207-5631-4f27-9e50-0af44a2479ae/view?access_token=36c21b9adeab75bda3cb1890aefe047843c15fb90d242fd11884a9baffcf218c).
